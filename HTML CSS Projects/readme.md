* It contains 3 projects That I have designed. 
It tooks 3 days for me to complete. 
* I have implemented multiple CSS properties into it and learned alot from it.
* It makes me amaze to see by using only `padding` and `margin` you can set things so much easily once you understood the core. 
* The properties I frequently used here are as follows :
```
- flex
- display
- position
- position : absolute
- position : relative
- padding
- margin
- border-radius
- width
- max-width
```
