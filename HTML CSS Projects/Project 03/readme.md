# Trend 2025 

> ## Technology used - Pure CSS and HTML

* I have designed Trend home page using pure CSS and HTML.
* In this folder you will find [index.html](https://github.com/RautSneha/Full-Stack-JavaScript/blob/main/HTML%20CSS%20Projects/Project%2003/index.html) file containing site structure.
* [style.css](https://github.com/RautSneha/Full-Stack-JavaScript/blob/main/HTML%20CSS%20Projects/Project%2003/style.css) file contains all design and formatting data of css.
* [output.png](https://github.com/RautSneha/Full-Stack-JavaScript/blob/main/HTML%20CSS%20Projects/Project%2003/output.png) is desired output that we have achived using HTML - CSS.
